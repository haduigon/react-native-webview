# React Native WebView features:

- Splashscreen is shown till content is loaded

- As far as mobile web site uses url rewriting, Android manifest and Info.plist are properly configured. Also network security config is added.

-For IOS it is used a SafeAreaView

- What is not done. I still have problems with iPad, it works badly, I`l be highly gratefull for any advice.

# _Usage as always is very simple:_

To launch it on your PC, follow the instructions:

https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device

or just download it from the stores.

# Reflection

It took 23 uploaded builds to create App for both stores. I had thought it would be easy but it wasn't %)
